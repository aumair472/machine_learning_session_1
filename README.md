# Machine Learning Session 1 – Train/Test Split Practice

This notebook is my first hands-on machine learning session, where I learn how to:

- Load a dataset with **Pandas**
- Separate **features (X)** and **target (y)**
- Use **scikit-learn** to split the data into:
  - `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, `y_test`

## Steps Covered

1. **Import libraries**

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
