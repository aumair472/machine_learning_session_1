📊 #Student Performance Prediction — Linear Regression

This project builds a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict a student's Performance Index based on study habits, sleep hours, previous scores, extracurricular activities, and practice papers attempted.

The notebook covers the full ML workflow:

🚀 ##Key Steps

Load & explore dataset

Identify dependent/independent variables

Handle categorical data with One-Hot Encoding

Perform Train/Test Split

Check multicollinearity using VIF

Train a Linear Regression Model

Evaluate performance (R², MAE, RMSE)

Predict performance for a new student

📈 ##Model Performance

R²: 0.9890

MAE: 1.61

RMSE: 2.02

##Top positive predictors:

Hours Studied

Previous Scores

Sleep Hours

Extracurricular Activities

🧪 ##Sample Prediction

The model predicts a Performance Index of ~68.46 for a student with average study habits.
